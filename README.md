<img width=500 alt="Exoplanet" src="https://github.com/josifovskid/Portfolio-Summary/blob/main/exoplanet.jpg"/>

- Developed a solution to classifying astronomical objects detected with NASA's Kepler mission as an exoplanet, or not in Python with sklearn.
- Results: The $F_1$ score of the chosen model - Random Forest - is 0.9840.

- Developed regression models to determine the age of abalone marine snails based on their physical characteristics.

## [Modeling Population Dynamics](https://github.com/josifovskid/Scientific-Computing/tree/main/Modeling-Population-Dynamics)

<img width=800 alt="Model of lynx-hare interaction" src="https://github.com/josifovskid/Portfolio-Summary/blob/main/lynx_hare_model.png"/>

- Analyzed three different mathematical models of interactions between species: intraspecific competition, interspecific competition, and predation in MATLAB with the function pplane8.
- Modeled three study cases for each interaction:
  - spreading of SARS-CoV-2 in People's Republic of China as logistic growth,
  - competition between two species of paramecium for the same resource, and
  - predation between canadian lynx and horseshoe hare in the Hudson Bay from 1845 to 1935 in Python.

## [Falling Stick](https://github.com/josifovskid/Computational-Physics/tree/main/Falling-Stick)

![Falling stick](https://github.com/josifovskid/Portfolio-Summary/blob/main/falling_stick.png)

- Derived the Lagrangian of a fallin stick.
- Numerically calculated the time the stick takes to fall down.
- Checked the numerical computation experimentally, and confirmed it.
